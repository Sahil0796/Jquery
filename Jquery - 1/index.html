        Treat Myself is the third major-label studio album by American singer-songwriter Meghan Trainor (pictured). Epic Records released it on January 31, 2020, after delaying it for over a year while Trainor wrote more songs. She worked with producers including Mike Sabath and Tyler Johnson, and featured artists including Nicki Minaj and the Pussycat Dolls. The album is a pop, doo-wop, funk, and R&B album, with themes such as female duality, body image, self-esteem issues, and relationships. Trainor promoted it with public appearances and televised performances.
